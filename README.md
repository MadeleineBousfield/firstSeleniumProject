# First Selenium Project
This project was completed as part of a Udemy course: [The Complete 2024 Software Testing Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/testerbootcamp/?couponCode=ST15MT31224).

The purpose of this project was to introduce writing Selenium automation scripts in Maven with a simple project to open and close the Google browser. This also involved adding Selenium libraries to the Maven POM file from the Maven repository.
